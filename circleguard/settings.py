def _index_by_defaults_dict(key):
    """
    Returns the index of the key in its respective section in the DEFAULTS dict.
    Used to sort a QSettings#allKeys call by each key's position in DEFAULTS.

    Examples
    --------
    DEFAULTS = {
        "category1": {
            "item1": 0
            "item2": 1
        }
    }

    item1 would have an index in category1 of 0, and item2 would have an index
    of 1, so item1 gets sorted above item2 (ie _index_bu_defaults_dict(item1))
    returns 0 and _index_bu_defaults_dict(item2) returns 1.

    Notes
    -----
    Index relative to keys in other sections is not defined. Neither is the
    index if a key in the list does not appear in TYPES (ie, we don't have
    an entry for it in DEFAULTS). This is fine for our purposes, since this is
    only used in overwrite_config and the latter values get thrown out, and for
    the former we segregate keys by setting so only position relative to other
    keys in the section matters.
